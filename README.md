# 👋 Hey, I'm Michael

I'm learning and experimenting with **C programming** and **Rubber Ducky scripts** for the Flipper Zero.

## 🧠 What I Do

- 🛠 I write my own basic C code or **modify existing/faulty code** to make it work better.
- 🐥 I build or tweak **Rubber Ducky payloads** for the Flipper Zero to automate or test small tasks.

## 💡 Why I Do It

I'm not an expert—yet—but I enjoy **figuring things out**, breaking stuff, and learning how things work under the hood.

## 🔧 Interests

- Flipper Zero payloads  
- Embedded systems basics  
- USB automation and scripting  
- Debugging and code fixing
